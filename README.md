## Background
Nanopore sequencing is a nascent genomics field with many present and future applications in precision medicine, forensics, evolutionary biology, epidemiology, agriculture, etc. There are challenges in the data processing or the computational analysis side of nanopore sequencing due to the large volume of data and, thus, the amount of computational resources required.

## Project
A nanopore raw signal dataset for a single human genome is around 1TB in size when compressed using state-of-the-art methods. These datasets must be typically archived for various reasons and are very expensive given their sizes. Current compression methods use generic compression algorithms such as stream-variable-byte and zstd. In this project, you will study the properties of raw signals and develop novel compression strategies that provide far more compression than the existing state-of-the-art.
